            <h2>Born July 12, 1967...</h2>
            <p>
                ...in Kings Park, New York, John Petrucci began playing guitar at the young age of 12. Kings Park was just a small suburb hidden within
                Long Island, but Petrucci discovered a wide world through the play of the many progressive and metal powerhouses that came to prominence
                in the late 70's and 80's. Influenced by artists such as Steve Morse, Randy Rhoads, Steve Vai, and Alex Lifeson, he took his musical studies
                very seriously. When he graduated high school, this dedication would prove fruitful; along with close friend and bassist John Myung, he would 
                accept enrollment at the infamous <em>Berklee College of Music</em> in Boston. It was there at Berklee that they would meet drummer Mike Portnoy
                and form the core of what would soon become <em>Dream Theater</em>. Though Berklee is well known as a challenging institution that demands the 
                utmost of its students, Petrucci did not care to study, and instead wanted to focus purely on practice and recording music. He would soon leave
                Berklee along with his classmates to begin their progressive metal journey.
